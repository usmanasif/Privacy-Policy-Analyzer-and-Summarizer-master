As indicated by the term "directory", we only link to other people's patterns; none of the patterns are our own, nor will we ever try to claim that they are.TPC is basically a super search engine/directory just for tatters.It is not considered infringement or in any way wrong for websites to link to one another.If you are a website owner/maintainer that feels differently, and do not appreciate your free patterns being promoted by this directory, please feel free to let me know so that I can remove the link to your patterns.It is not a problem if you change your links, as TPC has an automated link checker that will let me know that the links no longer work.
