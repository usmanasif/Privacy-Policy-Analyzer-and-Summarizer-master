We will only process your Personal Data in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.For example, each time you visit the Services we and our third-party service providers automatically collect your IP address, mobile device identifier or other unique identifier, browser and computer type, access time, the Web page you came from, the URL you go to next, the Web page(s) that you access during your visit and your interaction with content or advertising on the Services.The Usage Data we collect is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Data.Many major Web services use cookies to provide useful features for their users.The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor.The information is aggregated and therefore anonymous.We use this information to help operate our Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Services.We use Google Analytics for this purpose.Google Analytics uses its own cookies.It is only used to improve how our Services works.For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Services and help the content of the pages you request load quickly.Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see adverts but they may not be relevant to you.Flash cookies are used for various purposes, including, without limitation, enabling a Flash feature and remembering your preferences.If you choose to adjust your Flash privacy settings on your device some features of the Services may not function properly.Pixel Tags
We also use "pixel tags," which are small graphic files that allow us and third parties to monitor the use of the Services and collect Usage Data.We use pixel tags, either provided by us or by our third-party advertisers, service providers and ad networks, to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our sites and Services and use them in combination with our cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you.In addition, we use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.If, however, you wish to register to become a member of the Services, you are required to provide certain Personal Data (for example, your name and e-mail address), and you must also provide a user name and password.We use your Personal Data to fulfil your requests for products and services, to improve our Services, to contact you from time to time, with your consent, about us and our products and services, and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.In addition, you are required to provide certain Personal Data when you submit a job application and supporting materials.If we combine Non-Personal Data with Personal Data, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.Personal Data, Non-Personal Data, and User Submissions are referred to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "User Information."In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.For example, if you create or log into your account through a third-party social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, email address, account information, photo and friends lists, and other information in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.If you visit our Services on a device through which you also interact with social networks or if you interact with us through a social media function such as a plug-in (for example, a Facebook "like" button) then you permit us to have on-going access to, to use and to store information from your social network profile (such as your name, email address, your friend list, photo, age, gender, location, birthday, social networking ID, current city, and the people/sites you follow) in accordance with this Privacy Policy.If you don't want a social network to collect the information about you as described above, or you don't want a social network to share it with us, please review the privacy policy, privacy settings and instructions of the applicable social network before you visit and use our Services.Our Information Sharing Practice
