This is a personal website written entirely by me, Amanda Torres, unless otherwise noted and with the major exception of the "Science!" portion, which contains re-posted abstracts obtained from PubMed with links to their locations on that website. Feel free to re-post any information from this website, but please provide a link back to the site if you do. Also, feel free to bring this information with you when you do talk to your doctor or other qualified medical practitioner about the right choices for your health and medical treatment. All information is shared purely for informational purposes only.
