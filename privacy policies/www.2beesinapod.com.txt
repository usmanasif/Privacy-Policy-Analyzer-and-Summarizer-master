centralization of authoritative Registrant Data at the registry level to ensure the ongoing continuity, stability and resiliency of the DNS;

Additionally, Donuts may use Registrant Data to (i) improve our Services, promotions and functionality, (ii) develop and collect aggregate statistics (ensuring appropriate anonymization) regarding our systems and Services, and (iii) communicate with you regarding your registration or related Services.
DATA CONTROLLER ROLES
Donuts collects and processes your Registrant Data to carry out the registration of your domain, to ensure that your registration functions as expected, and that registrations do not affect the security of our registry.  In order to enter your chosen domain name into our registry system, we are required to process your data in a manner obligated in our contracts with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).  In this respect, it is our understanding under applicable law that each of our TLD registries acts as a joint data controller of your data, working in conjunction with your registrar and ICANN, as herein described.
REGISTRY
The registrys joint controllership and our responsibility for your data is limited to only that data and the use of such data, which is necessary for the registration of domains within one of our TLDs.
REGISTRARS
With specific reference to the registration of a domain name, your registrar is responsible for:
collection of registration data;
providing you notice and an opportunity to review both the registrars privacy policy and our Privacy Policy (where we are the relevant registry); and
providing you with adequate information and a means by which you may exercise your individual privacy rights, such as data access, deletion, and rectification.
CHOICE OF REGISTRAR:  You should only choose a registrar with whom you feel comfortable sharing your information.  To that extent, the choice of registrar is solely a matter for you, as registrant. It is important that you familiarize yourself with and understand the individual and specific privacy policy of your registrar of choice.  If you do not understand such policies, or you have questions regarding any of these policies, you should discuss this with your registrar, prior to registration.
ICANN
ICANN is the private-sector body responsible for coordinating the global Internets systems of unique identifiers. The mission of ICANN is to coordinate the stable operation of the Internets unique identifier systems.  More information about ICANN can be found here: www.icann.org.

Donuts utilizes the services of Iron Mountain Inc., a US Corporation, with servers in the United States, as its Escrow Provider.
